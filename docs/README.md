# Laravel Training

## Introduction

In February 2019 I received a training course on Laravel, given by the
unsurpassable [Bobby Bouwmann](https://twitter.com/bobbybouwmann).

The training consisted of 5 days, spread over 3 weeks. After an introduction that
gave an overview of what Laravel is and what topics would be covered, there were
two block of two days each, in which the material was explored in more depth.

This repository is my write-up of what I learned, did and experienced during the
training.

### Where I'm coming from

I have worked with Laravel before (both version 4 and 5) but, as with a
plethora of other frameworks, my knowledge is mostly superficial.

You know the drill: dive in, get things done, move on.

Being presented with the opportunity to gain more in-depth knowledge of a
framework my [employer](https://www.takeaway.com) will be working with, I was
excited to get started.

As with programming languages, I hate all frameworks equally, but for different
reasons.

With Laravel, [the things I dislike most are its Facades and helper functions](./what-i-dislike-about-laravel/).

One of the things I was really interested in was learning how to use the
framework without these.

Another thing I was hoping to achieve during this training, is to set up some
rules and guidelines for working with Laravel that is more sustainable for
long-term projects.
